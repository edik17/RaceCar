Formula 1 is a pencil and paper game that is played on a sheet of squared paper, on which a fantasy car circuit is drawn, with a starting line and a finish line (which can also coincide if the circuit is circular). The game simulates a race by taking into account the inertia of the vehicles (for example, you need to brake when facing a curve).

A complete description of the game and its rules is available at the following link.

The goal of the project is to create classes that allow you to manage a competition where interactive players (humans) and bot players (programmed) compete to win the competition.
